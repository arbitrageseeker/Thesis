# 4 Data

## 4.1 Sample Selection


Since the country information of the institutions in the 13F data is only from June 1997, I limit the sample to include US listed firms (NYSE, AMEX and Nasdaq) during the period of 1997-2017. Data for foreign, domestic and institutional shareholdings is retrieved from Thomson Reuters institutional holdings (form 13F) database. To calculate the stock price related control variables, the information asymmetry proxies *BID_ASK_SPREAD*, *VCV* and foreign, domestic and institutional ownership measures, I gather stock price information from the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP). Accounting related control variables are collected from COMPUSTAT. The 13F data is merged with CRSP by matching the 8-digit CUSIP identifier from 13F to the 8-digit NCUSIP from CRSP. I use CRSP-COMPUSTAT Merged Database (CCM) to merge CRSP and COMPUSTAT datasets. Firm-year estimates of information asymmetry proxies *PIN^~BHL~* [@brown2004conference], *PIN^~BH~* [@brown2007disclosure], *PIN^~EHO~* [@easley2010factoring], *PIN^~DY~* [@duarte2009pin], *Adjusted PIN* and firm-day estimates of *MIA* [@johnson2017simple] are collected from the cited authors’ websites [^1]. Information asymmetry measures are merged with the baseline sample by using the CRSP’s Permanent Issue Number (PERMNO) as a linking identifier.

respectively. Daily firm-level observations of MIA are made available by Travis Johnson (http://travislakejohnson.com/data.html).


## 4.2 Constructing the variables

I extract foreign ownership data from Thomson Reuters institutional holdings (form 13F) s34 master file. I define two variables *FOREIGN_HOLDINGS* and *FOREIGN_BREADTH* of which the former is defined as an annual average of the shares of a firm held by foreign institution at the end of each quarter divided by the firm’s total shares outstanding at the end of each quarter. The latter is defined as an annual average of the number of distinct foreign institutions holding shares in the firm at the end of each quarter divided the total number of institutions in the 13F database at the end of each quarter [@chen2002breadth; @lof2018asymmetric]. I retrieve shares outstanding data from CRSP monthly file. I also construct the variables for total institutional ownership *INSTITUTIONAL_HOLDINGS* and *INSTITUTIONAL_BREADTH* in a similar manner. In comparison of the firm-year level dataset in the baseline research setting, I construct the variables for the quasi-experimental research sample, I construct the variables similarly but at the firm-quarter level.  

I obtain data for information asymmetry measures of annual firm-level PIN and daily firm-level MIA observations from the cited researchers’ publicly available websites. I construct the firm-year observations of MIA by calculating the annual average of daily observations for each firm. Data for proxy measure VCV is retrieved from CRSP daily stock file. Following Lof and van Bommel (2018), I construct the annual firm-level observations of VCV by computing the fraction of the annual standard deviation of daily trading volumes and the annual average of daily trading volumes. I require firms to have at least 200 days with a positive trading volume in a year. Similarly, I calculate the *VCV* using three different measures of trading volume: volume in US dollars, volume market shares and turnover.

I gather control variables data from COMPUSTAT quarter fundamentals and CRSP monthly stock files. I compute *LOG_MARKET_CAP* by multiplying market price of each stock by the shares outstanding at the end of each quarter, converting it to an annual average and taking the logarithm of this measure. *BM_RATIO* is an annual average of the stock's book value of equity divided by the market value at the end of each quarter. *LEVERAGE* is an annual average of the stock's total debt divided by total assets at the end of each quarter. *ROA* is an annual average of the stock's net income divided by total assets at the end of each quarter. I use SIC codes from CRSP to capture the corresponding industry for each stock.

## 4.3 The quasi-natural experiment

For the quasi-natural experiment, I limit the time period of the original sample to 1997-2011 to cover the time period of 22 distinct brokerage closures from June 2000 until January 2008 listed in Appendix A of Kelly and Ljungqvist (2012) plus three years of pre- and post-treatment periods. I identify stocks that lose an analyst covering the firm because of the brokerage closures which provide a source of exogenous variation for the analyst coverage. The list is matched with an analyst coverage data retrieved from the Institutional Brokers’ Estimate System (IBES) detail file. 
To construct the sample of treated firms, I filter out firms that are not covered by analysts employed in the brokerage houses listed in Appendix A of @kelly2012testing. Following @derrien2013real, I require for the treated firms to be covered by an analyst at least one year before the disappearance dates to filter out firms that are not actively covered by the analysts. Furthermore, following @kelly2012testing and @derrien2013real, I only retain firms for which the analyst has not “stopped” his estimate before the corresponding broker disappearance date to eliminate the potential endogeneity problem. For instance, if an analyst terminates the coverage of firms unrelated to the brokerage closure before the disappearance date (e.g. anticipating changes in corporate policies), the decision is endogenous. I collect the data for stopped estimates from IBES stop file. Since the brokerage closure dates listed by @kelly2012testing and corresponding disappearance dates do not coincide completely, I follow @derrien2013real, @he2013dark and @lof2018asymmetric to construct a three-month gap before and after the event date. As a result, I estimate the dependent variables and explanatory variables for each stock in a given quarter by subtracting (adding) three months from the event date and finding the previous (next) available quarter value for before and after measures, respectively. Moreover, I define the variable *ANALYST_COVERAGE* as the number of distinct analysts covering a firm in a given quarter.
